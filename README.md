📌 **Credit Card Transaction & Customer Analytics Project**

I recently completed an end-to-end data analytics project using Excel, PostgreSQL, and Power BI, focused on uncovering meaningful insights from credit card transaction and customer data. This project involved the complete lifecycle of data handling—from raw CSV files to a fully interactive BI dashboard.

**Project Workflow**

1. Started with two CSV datasets in Excel, each containing more than 10,000 rows of credit card transaction and customer information.
2. Designed and created a relational database in PostgreSQL.
3. Built two tables:
   • **cc_detail** for the Credit Card Transaction Report
   • **cust_detail** for the Credit Card Customer Report
4. Loaded all data into PostgreSQL and validated data types, structures, and integrity.
5. Connected PostgreSQL to Power BI through a pipeline.
6. Performed data cleaning and error handling in Power Query.
7. Used DAX to create additional calculated columns and measures to enrich the analysis.
8. Designed two comprehensive dashboards in Power BI showcasing actionable business insights.

This project enhanced my skills across SQL data modeling, Power BI data transformation, DAX calculations, and business-focused dashboard design. It also strengthened my understanding of customer behavior, spending patterns, and revenue drivers in the credit card domain.

Looking forward to applying these learnings to more real-world datasets and business problems.
